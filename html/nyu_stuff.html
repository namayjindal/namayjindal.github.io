                    <h2>Product Team at NYU's Product Management Club</h2>
                    <p>My freshman year of college I was introduced to the role of being a product manager through this club, and I was hooked. I joined the mentorship program, joined the Executive Board, met some really cool people, but it still didn't feel enough.

                    I wanted to be able to help people who were looking to break into this role but didn't have the resources to learn anything about it in a hands on manner. There were barely any internships available for PM, and no course we could take at NYU. I decided to start the Product Team program within PMC that would take on a small exclusive cohort of students and attempt to simulate the experience of being a PM.

                    I ran this program for 2 semesters (Fall 2024 and Spring 2025), where we covered 4 companies each semester with students who covered the fundamentals from user research all the way through prototyping and roadmapping. We built a comprehensive curriculum after speaking with 30+ PMs from various companies, and we were able to attract some really cool people to participate. Here's the link to the program's web page, where we hope to include some of the team's best work soon - <a href="https://www.nyupmc.com/product-team-1">Product Team</a></p>

                    <h2>Datathon and Project Expo at NYU's Data Science Club</h2>
                    <p>At NYU's Data Science Club, I held the position of Director of Outreach for 3 semesters on the E-Board. During this time, we organized 2 datathons (hackathon, but with data) and 1 project exposition, reaching 200+ students.

                    I particularly enjoyed organizing the datathon in Spring 2025, which was a collaboration with <a href="https://get.corner.inc/">corner</a> and NYU Business Analytics Club. We had 70+ students register, and the prompts by themselves were incredibly well designed with loads of scope for creativty. I helped source speakers for 2 workshops leading up to the event, along with moderating a fireside chat with the founders of corner. The 24 hour datathon was well received, and the winners received prizes worth $700 along with merch from corner and mentorship sessions.

                    You can find more information about this datathon here! - <a href="https://dscnyu.vercel.app/">datathon website</a>
